# TestProject

Project created in MVVM architecture in XML/fragments, following the latest techniques.

Created using Dependency Injection (Dagger/Hilt), Coroutines, Glide (Images), encrypted Room local storage (also used for filters as the API does not allow it).

Tested using Espresso, Jacoco as well as tested for memory leaks with LeakCanary.
